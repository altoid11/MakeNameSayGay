# MakeNameSayGay
I have very high hopes and plans for this project. It takes your full name and replaces all letters except "g" "a" and "y" with X so it says for example XXgXXXaXXXXyXX. I have many bugs and plans to make the users name spell other dirty and salacious things.

The code currently has issues if the "a" or "y" are repeated multiple times. It has issues if there is no "g" "a" or "y". It is untested if capitals work. the lack of a letter can easily be fixed with a try statement that will simply say "you are not gay" or something of equivalent value. The way it's written is absolutely horrible and much worse than it needs to be, sorry for that. I will continue to update this code until it is perfect.
